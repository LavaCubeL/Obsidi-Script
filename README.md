# Obsidi-Script

A small experimental programming language created as part of a Programming Languages course

## Overview
This project explores how programming languages work internally by implementing core components such as tokenization, parsing, and interpretation

## Goals
- How an interpreted language works
- The logic behind implementing a lexer, parser, and interpreter

## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to:
- Parse raw input text
- Tokenize input into tokens
- Design basic grammar rules
- Think about the structure and responsibilities of an interpreter

## Features
- Custom lexer/tokenizer
- Basic parsing logic
- Structured token output
- Simple error handling
- Converts basic inputs from a text file into LaTeX-compatible output for use in Obsidian

## Tech Stack
- Language: Java  
- Concepts: Lexer, Tokens, Parsing, Language Design

## Project Status
**Educational Project**  
This project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes and may be extended in the future
